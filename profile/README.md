## Welcome to thrash.cloud

`thrash.cloud` is a grass-roots project to build a decentralised, ephemeral compute cloud with low carbon footprint. 
We aim to build a solution that's easily usable by DevOps engineers using common skillsets, both for deploying workloads as well as deploying compute nodes.

`thrash.cloud` is currently a proof of concept. We hope one day to turn it into a community initiatives of hackers like [freifunk](https://freifunk.net).
